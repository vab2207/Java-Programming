Java Basics - Introduction

Java is a popular programming language used to make many applications. It was created by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java is simple, secure, and platform-independent, which means you can run Java programs on any computer that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Java programs are first written in files called source code files with extension `.java`. These files are then compiled into bytecode (`.class` files) using the Java compiler (`javac`). The JVM runs this bytecode on your computer.

Key points about Java:
- Java is Object-Oriented Programming language.
- Java is platform independent because of JVM.
- Java has automatic memory management with Garbage Collection.
- Java programs start execution from the `main()` method.
- Every Java program has at least one class.

Basic Structure of a Java Program:

>java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}


--Topics Included:

Java Program Structure – class, method, main method, syntax rules

Data Types – byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean

Variables – declaration, initialization, naming rules

Type Casting – widening and narrowing with examples

Operators – arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, unary, ternary

Keywords – static, final, public, class, void, return

Input/Output – using Scanner class and System.out

Comments – single-line, multi-line (for clean code writing)

Basic Error Handling – compile-time vs runtime error examples


--Objectives:

Build a strong base for learning OOP, Data Structures, and Java frameworks

Be able to answer “Explain Java basics” in interviews confidently

Practice industry-standard syntax and logic using simple code
