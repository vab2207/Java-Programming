This folder explains how Java handles errors using exception handling.

Key concepts:
- What is an exception
- Types of exceptions (checked and unchecked)
- try-catch block
- finally block
- throw and throws keywords
- creating custom exceptions

This helps us avoid program crashes and handle errors in a clean way.
