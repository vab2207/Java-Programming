This folder covers the concept of recursion in Java.

Recursion means a method calling itself again and again until a condition is met.

Key concepts:
- What is recursion
- Base condition and recursive call
- Examples: factorial, fibonacci, GCD
- Recursion vs loops

Important points:
- Every recursion must have a stopping condition
- Uses function stack memory (LIFO)

Recursion helps in solving problems like tree traversal, backtracking, and mathematical problems in an easy way.
