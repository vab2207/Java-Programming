This folder explains how to write classes inside other classes in Java. These are called nested classes.

Types of nested classes:
1. Non-static inner class
2. Static nested class
3. Local inner class (inside method)
4. Anonymous inner class

Key uses:
- Grouping related classes together
- Better code organization
- Can access outer class members

Example use case: creating helper classes used only inside one outer class.
