Arrays in Java

Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same data type in a single variable. This makes memory management more efficient and simplifies operations on data collections.

Types of Arrays in Java:

1. One-Dimensional Array:
- Simple linear list of elements.
- Example: int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};

2. Two-Dimensional Array:
- Matrix-like structure with rows and columns.
- Example: int[][] matrix = {{1,2}, {3,4}};

3. Jagged Array:
- Array of arrays with different row lengths.
- Example: 
int[][] jagged = new int[3][];
jagged[0] = new int[2];
jagged[1] = new int[3];

Common operations:
- Traversing
- Insertion and Deletion
- Searching
- Sorting
- Summation and Aggregates

Arrays are fixed in size. For dynamic alternatives, Java provides ArrayList.
