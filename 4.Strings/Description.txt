Strings in Java are objects that represent sequences of characters. They are widely used to store and manipulate text data. Java provides many built-in methods to perform operations like comparing, searching, modifying, and converting strings.
There are three main types of string handling in Java:

String class: Immutable sequences of characters. Once created, string objects cannot be changed.

StringBuffer class: Mutable strings which can be modified without creating new objects. Thread-safe but slower.

StringBuilder class: Similar to StringBuffer but faster and not thread-safe.

This topic covers all these string types and their common methods for effective programming.S
