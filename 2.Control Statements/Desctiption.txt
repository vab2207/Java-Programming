Control Statements:

Control statements are used in Java to manage the flow of execution in a program. They help the program take decisions and repeat certain tasks when needed.

1. Conditional Statements

Purpose:

To make decisions based on conditions. These statements help the program choose between different paths.


-Types:

if statement – runs a block of code only if the condition is true.

if-else statement – chooses between two blocks of code based on true or false condition.

if-else-if ladder – checks multiple conditions in sequence.

nested if – uses one if inside another for complex decisions.

Common Uses:

Checking login credentials

Grade calculation based on marks

Age-based permissions

Simple comparison logic

2. Looping Statements (will be added next)

Purpose:

To repeat a set of statements multiple times until a condition is false.


-Types:

for loop – used when the number of iterations is known.

while loop – used when the number of iterations is not known in advance.

do-while loop – similar to while, but executes the loop at least once.

Common Uses:

Printing patterns

Repeating menus

Running counters

Processing arrays or lists
