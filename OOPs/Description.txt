OOPs - Object Oriented Programming in Java

This folder has all the important topics of OOPs with basic programs.

OOPs means Object Oriented Programming. It is a method of writing code using objects and classes. It helps us organize code in a better and more real-life way.

Main Concepts Covered:

Class and Object
- Class is a blueprint or model.
- Object is created from a class and has real data.
- Example: class = Laptop, object = myLaptop

Inheritance
- One class can take properties of another class.
- Used to reuse code.
- Types of inheritance:
  1. Single
  2. Multilevel
  3. Hierarchical
  4. Multiple (using interface)
  5. Hybrid (combination using interfaces)

Polymorphism
- One thing can behave in many ways.
- Method Overloading (same method name, different arguments)
- Method Overriding (child class changes parent method)

Abstraction
- Hiding unnecessary details and showing only the important parts.
- Done using abstract classes and interfaces.

Encapsulation
- Wrapping data using private variables.
- Access is given using getter and setter methods.


Purpose:

To understand all 5 core OOP concepts with simple examples. 
Helps in building strong basics for Java coding, interviews, and projects.
